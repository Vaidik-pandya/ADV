*(Expanded with more recent, exploitable CVEs for 2024‚Äì2025)*

---

## How to Use:  
Each entry highlights a critical Cisco vulnerability with discovery and exploitation details valuable for bug bounty and black-box offensive security testing.

---

### 1. CVE-2023-20198 & CVE-2023-20273 ‚Äî IOS XE Web UI Privilege Escalation + Command Injection
- **Discovery:** Identify Cisco IOS XE web interfaces (`/login`, `/webui`) on routers/switches.
- **Exploitation:** Abuse the web UI to gain level 15 (admin) access, then use the session to exploit command injection for arbitrary OS command execution.
- **Impact:** Full device compromise, including persistent access and arbitrary code execution.
- **Tips:** Always test for both authenticated and unauthenticated vectors, as combinations are possible.[2][10]

---

### 2. CVE-2024-20414 (and CVE-2024-20419) ‚Äî Web UI CSRF & Password Reset
- **Discovery:** Probe the web UIs of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, as well as Cisco Smart Software Manager (SSM).
- **Exploitation:** 
  - CSRF: Trick an admin into clicking a malicious link, sending a GET request that alters config or executes commands.
  - Password Reset: Exploit SSM with a crafted HTTP request allowing arbitrary password change for admin accounts.
- **Impact:** Complete admin compromise or unauthorized configuration changes.[1][13]

---

### 3. CVE-2024-20481 ‚Äî ASA/FTD Denial of Service (Critical, CVSS 9.8)
- **Discovery:** Identify Cisco ASA or Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) web VPN endpoints exposed to the internet.
- **Exploitation:** Send a specially crafted HTTP request to cause crash/service outage (DoS).
- **Impact:** Network disruption and firewall outage.[5]

---

### 4. CVE-2024-20359 (‚ÄúArcaneDoor‚Äù) ‚Äî Remote Code Execution in ASA/FTD
- **Discovery:** Find and fingerprint VPN/web management interfaces. Look for devices not updated post-April 2024.
- **Exploitation:** Remotely execute malicious code by leveraging flaws in management/VPN web servers‚Äînation-state actors have used this for persistent backdoor access and espionage.
- **Impact:** Total device takeover, surveillance, or access to protected networks.[7][9]

---

### 5. CVE-2024-20353 ‚Äî ASA/FTD Web Server DoS
- **Discovery:** Same method as above; specific protocol fuzzing or web management endpoints.
- **Exploitation:** Crash device with a crafted remote request, resulting in denial of service for clients and administrators.
- **Impact:** Immediate loss of availability; critical for targets where uptime is vital.[7][9]

---

### 6. CVE-2024-20401 ‚Äî Arbitrary File Write in Secure Email Gateway
- **Discovery:** Test Secure Email Gateway (AsyncOS) interfaces with file scanning and filtering enabled.
- **Exploitation:** Upload malicious attachments to force arbitrary file write, then escalate to root by modifying config, adding users, or dropping backdoors.
- **Impact:** Persistence, code execution, full system compromise. [13]

---

### 7. CVE-2025-20281 & CVE-2025-20282 ‚Äî Remote Code Execution in Cisco ISE and ISE-PIC
- **Discovery:** Locate Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) and ISE-PIC web admin consoles.
- **Exploitation:** Exploit internal API to upload arbitrary files, then leverage for RCE and root access on the device.
- **Impact:** Root compromise‚Äîcould lead to entire network access via privilege escalation.[6]

---

### 8. Directory Traversal & Arbitrary File Read (e.g., ASA WebVPN/Previous Years)
- **Discovery:** Test for traversal patterns across all Cisco web UIs, especially VPN or device management portals (`/../`, `%2e%2e/`).
- **Exploitation:** Read sensitive configs, credentials, or system files remotely.
- **Impact:** Information disclosure leading to further privilege compromise.[6][19]

---

### 9. Cross-Site Scripting & Open Redirects in Cisco Web UIs (Multiple CVEs)
- **Discovery:** Fuzz parameters in login, alert, or log viewing UIs for reflected/stored XSS (`<script>`, `"><img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`).
- **Exploitation:** Steal admin sessions or escalate access using social engineering via open redirects.
- **Impact:** Session hijack, social engineering chain attacks.[5][8]

---

### 10. SSRF via API/Config Endpoints (Multiple Products)
- **Discovery:** Identify URL parameters in device config, reporting, or diagnostic endpoints.
- **Exploitation:** Send payloads referencing internal IPs/services (e.g., `http://169.254.169.254/` for cloud metadata).
- **Impact:** Internal port scans, unauthorized metadata exfiltration or access to protected services.[4][8]

---

### 11. Default, Hardcoded Credentials & Brute-force Opportunities
- **Discovery:** Attempt known default passwords on first setup, legacy firmware, or recovery interfaces; reference Cisco documentation and password lists.
- **Exploitation:** Gain initial foothold, move laterally, or escalate. Pair with brute-force/dictionary attacks on non-rate-limited login pages.
- **Impact:** Immediate admin/internal access on legacy or poorly maintained devices.

---

### 12. RCE/DoS via HTTP/2 or IPv4 Fragments (Recent Protocol Bugs)
- **Discovery:** Fuzz for HTTP/2 protocol quirks or invalid IPv4 fragmentation in newer Cisco IOS/IOS XE releases; see semiannual Cisco advisories for fresh vectors.[12][20][16]
- **Exploitation:** Crash or remotely execute code by manipulating web protocols or IPv4 fragments in network traffic.
- **Impact:** Device outage or full compromise.

## Recommended Tooling for Cisco Bug Hunting
- **Nuclei Templates:** Regularly check [ProjectDiscovery Nuclei Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) for Cisco-focused CVEs and web UI issues.
- **RouterSploit & Metasploit:** Frameworks kept up to date with modules for Cisco device exploits.
- **Burp Suite:** For custom HTTP/S request tampering, XSS/CSRF/SSRF discovery, and brute-forcing.
- **Custom Scripts:** Used for protocol fuzzing (DoS, traversal, HTTP/2 edge cases).
- **Shodan/Censys:** Finding exposed Cisco web services (VPN, management UI, REST/SOAP APIs).
